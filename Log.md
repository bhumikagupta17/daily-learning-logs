 **Focus:** Version Control & DSA (LeetCode 75)

**1. Git & GitHub Fundamentals**
- Learned the core workflow: `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`.
- Understood the difference between the **Working Directory**, **Staging Area**, and **Local Repository**.
- *Action:* Initialized this tracking repository and pushed first commits.

**2. DSA Practice**
- **Problem:** Sort Colors (LeetCode #75)
- **Approach:** Counting Sort (Two-Pass).
   1. Counted frequency of 0s, 1s, and 2s in the first pass.
   2. Overwrote the original array based on counts in the second pass.
- **Complexity:** Time $O(N)$ (2N traversals) | Space $O(1)$
